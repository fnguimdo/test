- [ ] Vendors need to support IBM Watson (our AI offerings) on their platform in order for IBM Cloud Satellite to operate.
- [X] IBM needs to first deliver Cloud Paks as a Service (CPaaS) so that IBM Cloud Satellite can benefit from the "as-a-service" delivery model and automation.
- [ ] Vendors need to be willing for IBM to pre-install IBM Cloud Private on their servers.

### Q11. Why does IBM consider earlier iterations of the IBM Cloud Paks architecture as too "vertical"?

- [ ] Customers were getting too lost in the depth of capabilities packed into every Cloud Pak.
- [ ] The early Cloud Paks had such a steep learning curve that few were able to get started.
- [X] The individual Cloud Paks were too siloed and not as tightly integrated as our customers desired.

### Q13. Foundational Services can be organized into five pillars or grouping of capabilities, services, and components. Which pillar focuses on metering and licensing?

- [ ] Application Services
- [ ] Data and Event Services
- [ ] User Experience Services `X`
- [X] Operational Services

### Q14. You're talking to an existing IBM customer who had previously invested in IBM Cloud Paks. As you bring up the substantial evolution of our Cloud Paks architecture, you see some skeptical looks across the room — perhaps the customer is concerned this might mean having to learn a whole new interface or scrap everything they've learned about the platform already? How would you describe the benefit of the next generation of Cloud Paks and put your customer's mind at ease?

- [ ] Future iterations of Cloud Paks will all have identical (uniform) pricing.
- [ ] Every Cloud Pak will now run on a separate OpenShift cluster.
- [X] Cloud Pak capabilities will be less siloed because Foundational Services will make it easier to integrate and work across multiple Cloud Paks.

### Q21. Why did IBM choose to re-organize the Cloud Paks and Foundational Services architecture into 3 core pillars?

- [ ] One pillar is targeted at "do it yourself" (DIY) deployments, a second pillar at customer-managed deployments, and a third pillar is for IBM-managed deployments.
- [ ] One pillar is for on-premises, a second for public cloud, and a third pillar is for hybrid multicloud.
- [ ] Going forward, there will only be 3 IBM Cloud Paks offered to the market.
