#### Q4. You're preparing to talk to a client that you know is on a transformational journey to cloud-native application development. They have lots of legacy applications built in a monolithic manner with their own monitoring and observability tooling. You need this client to understand how things change from an observability perspective with modernized application development. What is the main point you want to get across?

- [ ] As applications modernize, legacy Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools collect too much data
- [ ] As applications are refactored to Microservices, the number of components decreases, making it more difficult to have visibility
- [ ] As applications are refactored to Microservices, the number of connections between services decreases, making it more difficult to have visibility
- [X] Those very things that are streamlining application development make it harder to monitor and remediate and stabilize the production deployments

#### Q5. You're presenting the topic of Observability vs. Monitoring at a regional user group (RUG) meeting and close out your session by talking about Instana and then open it up for a Q&A session. Someone asks you "What makes Instana's profiling capabilities unique and differentiated", You say
 
- [ ] Since Instana provides line-of-code visibility all the time, there is no need for profiling
- [X] Instana provides a snapshot of the application stack so that the profiler can replicate what happened in production
- [ ] The capability helps kick-off an on-demand profiling session on any supported code base
- [ ] Instana profiling is an automated and continuous production profiler which enables clients' to continuously analyze code-level performance in production 

#### Q6. A request for proposal (RFP) has come to your team around the topic of automation for both IT and business. You're obviously expecting some stiff competition for this business. What Instana differentiator would be the best to ensure is included in the RFP's response?

- [ ] Gartner MQ for Application Performance Monitoring (APM) is not relevant. Instana is the leader in Gartner MQ for Observability.
- [ ] Instead of trusting Gartner MQ, take a look at the real experts in the Observability industry “APM Experts”, who ranked Instana #1.
- [ ] Instana moved up and to the right, while the legacy APM tools moved down. Instana is disrupting the industry. G2 Crowd rates Instana very highly against the competition.
