#### Q1. You're having a virtual meeting with a client about IBM's Hybrid Cloud strategy and it's time to wrap things up; you want to ensure the client walks away with the strategy's critical tenets, so you write on the Mural what four words to finish off?

- [ ] Automate, Secure, Scale, and Predict
- [ ] Secure, Modernize, Announce, and Automate
- [ ] Automate, Secure, Modernize, and Predict
- [ ] Modernize, Predict, AI, and Secure

#### Q2. IBM has defined three critical ingredients for successful enterprise AI projects. One of these key ingredients is 'Language'. What does Language mean in this context?

- [ ] Language is about unlocking deeper intelligence by understanding the language of business through analysis of sentiment, summarizations, briefs, extracts (and documents of all types) by discovering, extracting, translating, and correlating insights.
- [ ] AI deployments require significant documentation and direction for end-users.
- [ ] Ensuring that the developers choose the correct language model to increase the frequency of correct predictions.
- [ ] Ensuring that the AI models are delivered in the target audience's preferred language, with all translations handled by AI and not a human translator.

#### Q3. The ability to contextualize how and why and AI system arrived at a particular result or conclusion is referred to as what?

- [ ] Trustworthiness. The AI system must be trusted.
- [ ] Transparency. The AI system must be transparent.
- [ ] Explainabilty. The AI system must be explainable.
- [ ] Openness. The AI system must be open.

#### Q4. You are with a prospect and they suggest to you that they don't need AI as they have recently rolled out Automation. How do you respond?


Defer the client question until an expert can be brought in to explain the difference.

Since the client has rolled out Automation you should change tactics and move away from an AI discussion.

Quickly suggest to the client that IBM Automation is significantly better than the Automation that they currently rolled out and they should begin an aggressive replace strategy.

Suggest to the client that AI is often closely associated, or used interchangeably, with automation. There is nuance between the two terms. Automation is the application of technology, programs, robotics, or processes to achieve outcomes with minimal human output. So not all forms of automation are – or incorporate – AI.



#### Q5.What is the largest benefit that CVS saw after they delivered a customer care application with Watson Assistant?


CVS has been able to successfully open more drive-thru stations across the continental United States.

CVS has successfully freed up significant operational expenditures (OPEX) funds which will pave the way for additional services including groceries and stationary items.

By handling more customer questions through Watson Assistant, CVS was able to increase sales in their website in the face of vicious competition for Amazon's PillPak pharmacy.

By deflecting millions of calls that would have otherwise gone to live agents, CVS live agents can now focus their attention on higher-value tasks or complex issue resolution.



#### Q6.One element that underpins IBM's AI framework refers to the concept of 'Open and diverse ecosystem'. What exactly is this phrase referring to?


This element refers to the fact that organizations need to ensure that any groups building or maintaining AI models should be made of a collection of developers from different backgrounds and ethnicities.

To achieve trustworthy AI at scale, it takes more than one company or organization to lead a charge. Trustworthy AI relies on an open and inclusive ecosystem – a community of users and contributors, businesses and institutions across industry, academia and research; and a culture of diversity, inclusion, and shared responsibility.

This refers to the notion that organizations need to ensure that the Business Partner ecosystem they use to distribute the AI technologies have to represent all countries globally and cannot be North America focused.

AI models need to be built primarily by leveraging Open Source software to ensure that the everyone has equal access to the technology.
