#### Q1. You're having a virtual meeting with a client about IBM's Hybrid Cloud strategy and it's time to wrap things up; you want to ensure the client walks away with the strategy's critical tenets, so you write on the Mural what four words to finish off?

- [ ] Automate, Secure, Scale, and Predict
- [ ] Secure, Modernize, Announce, and Automate
- [ ] Automate, Secure, Modernize, and Predict
- [ ] Modernize, Predict, AI, and Secure

#### Q2. IBM has defined three critical ingredients for successful enterprise AI projects. One of these key ingredients is 'Language'. What does Language mean in this context?

- [ ] Language is about unlocking deeper intelligence by understanding the language of business through analysis of sentiment, summarizations, briefs, extracts (and documents of all types) by discovering, extracting, translating, and correlating insights.
- [ ] AI deployments require significant documentation and direction for end-users.
- [ ] Ensuring that the developers choose the correct language model to increase the frequency of correct predictions.
- [ ] Ensuring that the AI models are delivered in the target audience's preferred language, with all translations handled by AI and not a human translator.

#### Q3. The ability to contextualize how and why and AI system arrived at a particular result or conclusion is referred to as what?

- [ ] Trustworthiness. The AI system must be trusted.
- [ ] Transparency. The AI system must be transparent.
- [ ] Explainabilty. The AI system must be explainable.
- [ ] Openness. The AI system must be open.

#### Q4. You are with a prospect and they suggest to you that they don't need AI as they have recently rolled out Automation. How do you respond?


Defer the client question until an expert can be brought in to explain the difference.

Since the client has rolled out Automation you should change tactics and move away from an AI discussion.

Quickly suggest to the client that IBM Automation is significantly better than the Automation that they currently rolled out and they should begin an aggressive replace strategy.

Suggest to the client that AI is often closely associated, or used interchangeably, with automation. There is nuance between the two terms. Automation is the application of technology, programs, robotics, or processes to achieve outcomes with minimal human output. So not all forms of automation are – or incorporate – AI.



#### Q5.What is the largest benefit that CVS saw after they delivered a customer care application with Watson Assistant?


CVS has been able to successfully open more drive-thru stations across the continental United States.

CVS has successfully freed up significant operational expenditures (OPEX) funds which will pave the way for additional services including groceries and stationary items.

By handling more customer questions through Watson Assistant, CVS was able to increase sales in their website in the face of vicious competition for Amazon's PillPak pharmacy.

By deflecting millions of calls that would have otherwise gone to live agents, CVS live agents can now focus their attention on higher-value tasks or complex issue resolution.



#### Q6.One element that underpins IBM's AI framework refers to the concept of 'Open and diverse ecosystem'. What exactly is this phrase referring to?


This element refers to the fact that organizations need to ensure that any groups building or maintaining AI models should be made of a collection of developers from different backgrounds and ethnicities.

To achieve trustworthy AI at scale, it takes more than one company or organization to lead a charge. Trustworthy AI relies on an open and inclusive ecosystem – a community of users and contributors, businesses and institutions across industry, academia and research; and a culture of diversity, inclusion, and shared responsibility.

This refers to the notion that organizations need to ensure that the Business Partner ecosystem they use to distribute the AI technologies have to represent all countries globally and cannot be North America focused.

AI models need to be built primarily by leveraging Open Source software to ensure that the everyone has equal access to the technology.




#### Q7.You are prepping for a client engagement where you've been asked to speak on the topic of AI and how it can help their organization. What is likely one of the challenges the organization will face when thinking about leveraging AI?


Organizations need to leverage the Public Cloud AI but only 22% of organizations have moved their workloads to Cloud.

Many organizations today are working in a hybrid work model. AI requires significant teaming and doing so in a hybrid work model can be challenging.

Corporate buy in. Many organizations are still struggling with the value proposition of AI.

Data. 90% of an organizations data is inaccessible, untrusted, or unanalyzed.



#### Q8.AI, Machine Learning (ML), and Deep learning (DL) feel like buzz words these days because you hear about them so often in data strategy discussions. What's the best way to describe the relationship between AI, ML, and DL?


AI, ML, and DL are all terms that have the same meaning and therefore can be used interchangeably.

AI is the category term for technology that enables machines to learn and act from data and improve over time. AI includes ML and DL methods.

AI is a subset of ML but is a synonym for DL.

These terms are a hierarchy of features around modern analytics. ML is the top level in this hierarchy, followed by DL, followed by AI.



#### Q9.You're talking to a client about AI and get into the topic of automation. Someone in the room remarks in front of your sponsor that they see no value in AI as their organization has already deployed automation across their supply chain. How do you explain the value of AI and Automaton?


The benefits of AI are for specific supply chains only and this is why automating your supply chain feels like you've done all you can with AI

The integration of AI and automation, or intelligent automation, allows organizations to digitize and automate virtually any type of work at scale – whether it is for business automation, IT automation, or automation of AI

If the customer has Automation in place they do not need any AI functionality

AI and automation are the same thing ... so perhaps there's another organization within the enterprise that could benefit from an AI project

#### Q10.The first dimension of trustworthy AI is AI Ethics which are based on IBM's principles for Trust and Transparency. One of these principles describes the purpose of AI. Select the best statement you would use to best describe the purpose of AI to a client.


The purpose of AI is to begin to automate everything.

The purpose of AI is to augment human intelligence.

The purpose of AI is to deliver value to only a subset of the population.

The purpose of AI is to replace human intelligence.


#### Q11.Analyst validation can be a powerful sales tool. What award has IDC recently given to IBM's AI portfolio?


Watson ecosystem growth in 2020 through partners such as Gainsight, Medallia, Veritas, Lexis Nexis, Teladoc, and Ogilvy

Market leader in AI by IDC’s Artificial Intelligence Market for 2020

Recognition for IBM inventors who have consistently led the pack in granted AI patents, receiving more than 2,300 AI patents in 2020 alone

Acknowledgment of the $240M ten year commitment to AI research through the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, founded in 2017, as a true industrial-academic collaboration


#### Q12.A client is new to AI and tells you they understand what machine learning (ML) is ... machines that learn. But is confused with the term deep learning (DL), and asked you to explain what the word 'deep' means in DL. You tell them that DL is:


A subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks that uses multiple hidden layers to extract features from data.

Learning that goes beyond the operating system (OS) level and actually focuses on kernel development.

Refers to the best practice of always checking and testing your models to ensure they are still accurate.

Learning that took a significant time to train and develop.


#### Q13.Without an AI and hybrid cloud strategy that solves issues related to data and infrastructure, security and trust, and strategy and skills... how many companies will fail at their digital transformation plans?


56%

87%

27%

73%

#### Q14.You're talking to a client about IBM's Hybrid Cloud strategy and how the Red Hat Open Shift Container Platform (OCP) is at its core. The clients asks you to give them the top 3 things OCP provides them as part of IBM's strategy. You say ...
