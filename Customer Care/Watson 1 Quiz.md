## Watson 1
#### Q1. You're having a virtual meeting with a client about IBM's Hybrid Cloud strategy and it's time to wrap things up; you want to ensure the client walks away with the strategy's critical tenets, so you write on the Mural what four words to finish off?

- [ ] Automate, Secure, Scale, and Predict
- [ ] Secure, Modernize, Announce, and Automate `X`
- [X] Automate, Secure, Modernize, and Predict
- [ ] Modernize, Predict, AI, and Secure

#### Q2. IBM has defined three critical ingredients for successful enterprise AI projects. One of these key ingredients is 'Language'. What does Language mean in this context?

- [X] Language is about unlocking deeper intelligence by understanding the language of business through analysis of sentiment, summarizations, briefs, extracts (and documents of all types) by discovering, extracting, translating, and correlating insights.
- [ ] AI deployments require significant documentation and direction for end-users. `X`
- [ ] Ensuring that the developers choose the correct language model to increase the frequency of correct predictions. `X`
- [ ] Ensuring that the AI models are delivered in the target audience's preferred language, with all translations handled by AI and not a human translator.

#### Q3. The ability to contextualize how and why and AI system arrived at a particular result or conclusion is referred to as what?

- [ ] Trustworthiness. The AI system must be trusted. `X`
- [ ] Transparency. The AI system must be transparent. `X`
- [X] Explainabilty. The AI system must be explainable.
- [ ] Openness. The AI system must be open.

#### Q4. You are with a prospect and they suggest to you that they don't need AI as they have recently rolled out Automation. How do you respond?

- [ ] Defer the client question until an expert can be brought in to explain the difference.
- [ ] Since the client has rolled out Automation you should change tactics and move away from an AI discussion.
- [ ] Quickly suggest to the client that IBM Automation is significantly better than the Automation that they currently rolled out and they should begin an aggressive replace strategy.
- [X] Suggest to the client that AI is often closely associated, or used interchangeably, with automation. There is nuance between the two terms. Automation is the application of technology, programs, robotics, or processes to achieve outcomes with minimal human output. So not all forms of automation are – or incorporate – AI.

#### Q5.What is the largest benefit that CVS saw after they delivered a customer care application with Watson Assistant?

- [ ] CVS has been able to successfully open more drive-thru stations across the continental United States.
- [ ] CVS has successfully freed up significant operational expenditures (OPEX) funds which will pave the way for additional services including groceries and stationary items. `X`
- [ ] By handling more customer questions through Watson Assistant, CVS was able to increase sales in their website in the face of vicious competition for Amazon's PillPak pharmacy.
- [X] By deflecting millions of calls that would have otherwise gone to live agents, CVS live agents can now focus their attention on higher-value tasks or complex issue resolution.

#### Q6. One element that underpins IBM's AI framework refers to the concept of 'Open and diverse ecosystem'. What exactly is this phrase referring to?

- [ ] This element refers to the fact that organizations need to ensure that any groups building or maintaining AI models should be made of a collection of developers from different backgrounds and ethnicities.
- [X] To achieve trustworthy AI at scale, it takes more than one company or organization to lead a charge. Trustworthy AI relies on an open and inclusive ecosystem a community of users and contributors, businesses and institutions across industry, academia and research; and a culture of diversity, inclusion, and shared responsibility.
- [ ] This refers to the notion that organizations need to ensure that the Business Partner ecosystem they use to distribute the AI technologies have to represent all countries globally and cannot be North America focused.
- [ ] AI models need to be built primarily by leveraging Open Source software to ensure that the everyone has equal access to the technology.

#### Q7. You are prepping for a client engagement where you've been asked to speak on the topic of AI and how it can help their organization. What is likely one of the challenges the organization will face when thinking about leveraging AI?

- [X] AI is the category term for technology that enables machines to learn and act from data and improve over time. AI includes ML and DL methods.
- [ ] AI is a subset of ML but is a synonym for DL. `X`
- [ ] These terms are a hierarchy of features around modern analytics. ML is the top level in this hierarchy, followed by DL, followed by AI. `X`

#### Q9.You're talking to a client about AI and get into the topic of automation. Someone in the room remarks in front of your sponsor that they see no value in AI as their organization has already deployed automation across their supply chain. How do you explain the value of AI and Automaton?

- [ ] The benefits of AI are for specific supply chains only and this is why automating your supply chain feels like you've done all you can with AI
- [X] The integration of AI and automation, or intelligent automation, allows organizations to digitize and automate virtually any type of work at scale – whether it is for business automation, IT automation, or automation of AI
- [ ] If the customer has Automation in place they do not need any AI functionality
- [ ] AI and automation are the same thing ... so perhaps there's another organization within the enterprise that could benefit from an AI project

#### Q10. The first dimension of trustworthy AI is AI Ethics which are based on IBM's principles for Trust and Transparency. One of these principles describes the purpose of AI. Select the best statement you would use to best describe the purpose of AI to a client.

- [X] An AI system should be fair so it can help counter human biases and promote inclusivity and equitable treatment.
- [ ] So that everyone that is effected by the AI system is treated equally.
- [ ] To truly deliver an AI model that is fair, there needs to be 'winners' and 'losers' be it credit approval, sentencing guidelins, and so on...because that is how life works. `X`
- [ ] To ensure that everyone gets access to the same benefits provided by AI.

#### Q18. A client remarks to you that they hear about Watson all the time from IBM; in fact, they hear about it so much they candidly remark that they're not even sure what it is, so they ask you to explain it. You say...

- [ ] Watson is one of IBM's most successful branding strategies. The term 'Watson' is no longer used for any technology focused areas, it's simply used to generate an emotional attachment to the IBM brand.
- [ ] The IBM Watson portfolio helps put AI to work anywhere at scale, enabling more intelligent and trusted workflows that propel smarter business through business-ready tools, applications, and solutions. It is designed to reduce costs and hurdles of AI adoption, ensuring the responsible use of AI.
- [ ] Watson refers to IBM's AI-based competitive chess team, who are coached how to play chess by Watson.  While the team currently has a number of the top 10 players in the world,  it's innovations are available beyond the chess world for IBM clients to use the AI for their business needs.

#### Q21.A client has approached you out of great concerns around the use of AI from an ethics perspective. You talk to them about how IBM defines trustworthy AI using three dimensions. As you delve into the AI Ethics dimension, you note that "AI must be transparent". The client asks you to be more specific, and you respond ...

- [ ] Transparency refers to the disclosure of the underlying AI system. The AI system can show how the service works, evaluate its own functionality in terms of drift and fairnes, and the model's strengths and weakness can be easily understood and explained
- [ ] Transparency refers to making the source code available so that others can benefit from the work done
- [ ] Transparency refers to ensuring that the developers understand the outcomes of the AI models
- [ ] Transparency refers to an ability to the invoke a 'see source' command in any and all portions of the AI model

#### Q22.Recently a customer of a bank applied for an online credit approval and was rejected. That customer then called the help desk to see how the decision on the loan application could be reversed. What characteristic of the AI model underpinning the credit application needs to be present so that support agent can provide the necessary details to this customer?

- [ ] Fair. An AI system should be built in a way so that there is no biasness built into the model. Therefore a situation such as this would not happen because this person is an existing customer and even if they were not automatically approved they could get the credit approval by visiting the branch.
- [ ] Explainability. An AI system should be able to explain and contextualize how and why it arrived at a particular decision or conclusion. So that in this case, the agent could explain why the customer scored in a particular way and what actions they could take to remedy the situation.
- [ ] Equality. The AI system needs to treat every customer according to their standing with the bank.
- [ ] Robustness. The AI system should be built in a way that not only provides a decision, but also suggests to get approved for the credit they applied for.
