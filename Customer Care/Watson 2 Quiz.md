## Watson 2

#### Q1. You are involved in a discussion with the CEO of a mid-sized retail company about the merits of a virtual assistant solution for their organization. Throughout your conversation you pick up on the fact that this CEO is very security conscious and it seems to be at the root of any technology they bring into the organization.  The CEO goes on to tell you that they excluded Amazon from the deal because they feel that Amazon is their competitor.  What is your next move?

- [ ] Focus on the fact that IBM protects client’s data and insight: Google uses client’s data to improve their AI models. In July 2019 Google admitted to a breach that allowed humans to access data.
- [ ] Focus on the notion that IBM has the broadest Analytics suite in the market. This has been backed up numerous analyst and industry reports.
- [X] Focus on the fact that IBM protects client’s data and insight: Google uses client’s data to improve their AI models. In July 2019 Google admitted to a breach that allowed humans to access data. 
- [ ] Suggest to the CEO that IBM's Services arm is much better positioned to win out against Google which is not Enterprise ready.

#### Q2. You are prepping for an upcoming proof of concept (POC) on Watson Assistant. When deciding on the strategy for Watson Assistant Voice Interaction (WAVI) what is the best approach to take?

- [ ] The real value of WAVI is the overall experience - focus on the user journeys.

- [ ] Focus on the high level pitch and value proposition only.

#### Q4. You are prepping for an upcoming session with a new prospect and working on your elevator pitch. For the Market Landscape portion you want to focus on what trends for Watson Assistant?

- [ ] With the continued focus on AI, organizations need to get serious and adopt AI today. The COVID-related pandemic has proven to everyone that organizations are simply not making decisions on the right set of data
- [ ] After the COVID-related pandemic, it is very obvious that organizations will quickly abandon their digital go to market strategies and move back to traditional approaches.
- [ ] The COVID-related pandemic really showed the world that transparency is key, and as such organizations should look to a vendor who solutions are transparent.
- [X] The COVID-related pandemic has accelerated the need for organizations to address digital transformation. IBM is seeing an increased focus on the need to support user journeys through digital channels. Employees need more support than ever when working remote.

#### Q5. You are attempting to pay your internet bill online. During that experience you are asked multiple times for your account number, your phone number, and your date of birth. What are these all examples of? 

- [ ] Exemplary customer service. You need to ensure that you are speaking to the correct customer.
- [ ] Data Cleansing. By asking multiple times for what appears to be the same information - organizations are in fact validating the data that they are collecting.
- [ ] Data Gathering. AI needs data and this is how many organizations gather their data.
- [X] Friction. When friction is introduced into the customer journey it can cause significant customer satisfaction issues. 91% of customers will not return to business after a bad customer satisfaction issue.

#### Q6. If a customer is about to purchase Cloud Pak for Data plus all the Watson Cartridges, how many licenses do they need to get?

- [x] Watson Cartridges are not part of Cloud Pak for Data at this time.
- [ ] A single license gives clients entitlement to all the Watson Cartridges. They will also need to acquire a license for Cloud Pak for Data.
- [ ] Each of the Watson Cartridges are licensed separately so it depends on how many cartridges are needed.
- [ ] Cloud Pak for Data plus all the Watson Cartridges plus OpenShift are part of a single license.

#### Q7. A client asks you what is meant by Natural Language Processing (NLP), and you respond by saying "It is... "

- [ ] The method in which computers learn how to communicate with humans in consumer products such as Siri or Alexa.
- [X] The use of algorithms to extract data, parse it, and determine the properties of natural, human language in both spoken language or written text.

- [ ] The use of dictionaries and static files to estimate what humans are saying.

#### Q8. You are with a key retail client and they are impressed with Watson Assistant. During one of the meetings, someone in the decision team announces that they don't think moving forward makes a lot of sense as the CEO has recently indicated that next year the organization will be changing their go-to-market model and has requested that no decisions that relate to this opportunity be made until that new model is in place. How do you respond?

- [ ] You reply that regardless of the strategy going forward, IBM, with its depth and breadth in Analytics, will surely have a solution to address any number of different go-to-market models.
- [ ] You reply and suggest to the team that given this late breaking news, you agree that a proper decision cannot be made until the new go-to-market is well understood.
- [X] You reply with how Watson Assistant is an omni-channel virtual agent that can assist in any voice or digital platform, as well as adapt to their changing channels and services. In addition, clients can take advantage of the IBM AI Journey workshop as an important tool to select the optimal use case to prove business value.
- [ ] You reply with how Watson Assistant is a virtual agent that customers want to engage with and has proven to increase customer satisfaction by increasing first call resolution and decreasing wait times.

#### Q9. During a recent conversation with a prospect you learn that Google is the competition. Your internal champion tells you that Google is telling them that 'Google Speech performs better', what is your response?

- [ ] Watson Assistant is flexible for all types of users. IBM focuses on making its conversational platform and tooling more business user friendly; however, developers can choose to use the IBM user interface made for business users or APIs to build out their conversational applications. `X`
- [X] IBM’s Speech recognition capabilities have been proven to be better or on-par with Google. Additionally, IBM focuses on letting users customize the speech model to their use case in order to extract more insight from the spoken language. You offer to demo IBM's speech capabilities to the client.
- [ ] Google does perform better that is true. However, IBM's support for multiple languages can be a differentiator if deployed correctly. You offer to demo our language support.
- [ ] You suggest that Google Speech is in fact significantly slower and Google has struggled to make any product beyond Gmail and Google Maps stick in the market. 

#### Q10.You are involved in a battle with Microsoft around a virtual assistant opportunity and the decision seems biased towards Microsoft technologies.

You remember reading a quarterly earnings report for this client where the CEO remarked they have to find ways to lower costs as their supply chain costs rose and this is one of the reasons why profitability fell.  You ensure the client understands that:

- [ ] The average cost of a live agent call is $5 - $7 … if handled with a virtual assistant, it’s about 0.25 cents/call and you can cut your current labor budget targeted at customer service.
- [ ] The average cost of a live agent call is $3 -$4 … if handled with a virtual assistant, it’s about 0.25 cents/call and you can cut your current labor budget targeted at customer service.
- [ ] The average cost of a live agent call is $5 - $7 … if handled with a virtual assistant, it’s about 0.25 cents/call and you can have those employees focus on higher value customer interactions than basic rote answers.

#### Q17. You are having a conversation with a possible client, the contact expresses concern with Watson Assistant in general stating, "We like your stuff, but to be honest, we don't use the IBM Public Cloud, so Watson Assistant is not going to work for us." How do you respond?

- [X] Watson Assistant (and all IBM containerized software for that matter) can go where the data lives. Watson Assistant can be deployed anywhere; on premises, on IBM's Public Cloud, another cloud vendor, private cloud, you name it!
- [ ] Frankly, it is not valid.  Watson Assistant is an on-prem only offering, so IBM does not have to worry about the cloud infrastructure.

- [ ] MAU is a slang word detection and resolution algorithm that was recently added to Watson Assistant.
- [ ] MAU does not stand for anything, but it's measure for the number of 'clicks' a user takes. IBM will roll that up on a monthly basis to create a monthly charge.
- [ ] MAU stands for Microservice Activation Unit. It is the functionality that allows for Watson Assistant to be deployed in a federated environment.
